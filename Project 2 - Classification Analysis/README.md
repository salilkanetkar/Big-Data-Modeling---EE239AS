# Classification Analysis
Worked with “20 Newsgroups” dataset which is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic.  
Given the collection of documents with predefined class types, trained a classifier to group the documents into two classes.
Used LSI, PCA, TF-IDF for text analysis. Applied different learning algortihms like SVM, Naive Bayes.
