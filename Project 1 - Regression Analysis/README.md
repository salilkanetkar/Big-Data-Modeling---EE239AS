# Regression Analysis
Explored basic regression models on various datasets, along with basic techniques to handle over-fitting; namely cross-validation, and regularization. With cross-validation, tested how the model generalizes to unseen data by evaluating its performance on a set of data not used for training, while with regularization penalized overly complex models.
