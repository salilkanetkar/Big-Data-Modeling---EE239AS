Before executing the code, make usre that the two data set files are there in the appropraite folders.
'tweet_data' should contain the six train files.
'test_data' should contain the 10 test files.
You can place the code in the folder where these two files are and run it.

The codes are independent of each other and can be run separately.
Problem_1.py, Problem_2.py, Problem_3.py, Problem_4.py, Problem_5.py, Problem_6.py have the respective codes.
Some of the files ay write output files and images to the folfer.

For problem 6, you need to run these two commands on your terminal:

$ pip install -U textblob
$ python -m textblob.download_corpora lite.

After this, you can run Problem_6.py.
